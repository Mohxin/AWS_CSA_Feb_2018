Basics
 - Instances and AMIs
 
     On-Demand Instances - Pay for the instances that you use by the second, with no long-term commitments or upfront payments.
     
     Reserved Instances - Make a low, one-time, up-front payment for an instance, reserve it for a one- or three-year term, and pay a significantly lower hourly rate for these instances.
     
     Spot Instances - Request unused EC2 instances, which can lower your costs significantly.
