     Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to any running instance that is in the same Availability Zone. EBS volumes that are attached to an EC2 instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the instance.

### Pricing for Amazon EC2
 - Pricing
     
     On-Demand Instances - Pay for the instances that you use by the second, with no long-term commitments or upfront payments.
     
     Reserved Instances - Make a low, one-time, up-front payment for an instance, reserve it for a one- or three-year term, and pay a significantly lower hourly rate for these instances.
     
     Spot Instances - Request unused EC2 instances, which can lower your costs significantly.
