# Lambda Essentials: 
 - Lambda is a "serverless" computing platform.
 - Serverless means that you can run code without provisioning or managing servers.
     - So if you want to run code, you don't have to spin up an EC2 instance and install software, you can just create a "Lambda function", drop your code in it, and execute it.
 - Lambda scales the required compute power automatically with your code.
 - You pay only for the compute time you consume (to the millisecond).
 - By default, it is highly available, fault-tolerant, scalable, elastic, and cost efficient.
 - Lambda integrates with many other AWS services.
 - Current supported languages include:
     - Node.js
     - Java
     - C#
     - Python 

When should you use Lambda over Ec2? 
   - Generally you want to use Lambda when you want to run code that is in response to events, such as
       - Changes to Amazon S3 buckets.
       - Updates to an Amazon DynamoDB table.
       - Custom events generated by your applications or devices.
